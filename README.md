# Overview
The Loan Prediction Project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict loan approval statuses. By leveraging personal and financial data of applicants, this project aims to assist in making informed loan approval decisions.

# This project involves:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Feature engineering and model training.
- Model evaluation and performance comparison.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a synthetic dataset from Kaggle, containing: 20,000 records of personal and financial information.
- Target variable:
Loan Approval Status (binary classification).
